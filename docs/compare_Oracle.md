# Oracle SQL

I always forget the names of Oracle's esoteric (but powerful) language features.  Here are some to Google.

* **lead and lag functions for relative row access** - is this more powerful than window functions?  how? 
* **oracle model whitepaper** - appears to format data as a cube, and allow cell-like excel functions on that cube.  Isn't this just a window function again?  Maybe cleaner?
* **model dimension by, measures, rules** - more of the same?
* **oracle match_recognize** - No idea, looks neat.
