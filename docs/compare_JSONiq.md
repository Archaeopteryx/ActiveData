# JSONiq vs JSON Query Expressions (incomplete)

[JSONiq](http://www.jsoniq.org/) is combination of Python and SQL with a bit of it's own syntax mixed in. At first look, it uses list comprehensions heavily, which is good, yet it still forces you to define a free variable for iteration. It reads more like a procedural language; much like a Spark program and less like SQL; it has both variables and function declaration.
