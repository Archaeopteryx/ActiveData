ActiveData Tests
================

This test suite is primarily testing the logic primarily found in `pyLibrary.queries.es14`.  The eventual plan is to split the `pyLibrary.queries` modules into a separate library, but only once another datasource is given the Qb API, and these tests pass.  For example, there is already some limited ability to query memory (aka Python objects), but the API is not tested with this suite, and certainly not fast.  Other useful datastores can use Numpy or a traditional database.
